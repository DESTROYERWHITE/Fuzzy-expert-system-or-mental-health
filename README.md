Suoabase connector uses dart to connect the database tables and the fuzzy logic function on supabase(back-end) to the flutterflow used for user interface
note1: Flutter flow uses drag and drop without need for coding expect on wants to add a custom code to it which i didn't
note2: codes for the tables in the database are in SQL and can't really be added here else it would be confusing and wouldn't be meaningful without a table.
